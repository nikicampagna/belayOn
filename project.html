	<br><br>
	BelayOn, is a centralized climbing application that makes finding climbing partners and new climbing spots fast and easy. 
	The application provides a truly all-in-one platform that meets the needs of both new and existing climbers. 
	BelayOn centers around four key features. The first is our matching algorithm that ensures that you find quality belay partners that suit your needs. 
	Secondly, we have user profiles that allow users to learn more about the people they match with. We also allow users to update any part of their profile 
	to make sure that your profile, and the profiles of the people you match with, are fully up to date. Our interactive map allows users to find climbing 
	locations nearby and across the globe. Finally, we have a real-time chat that allows users to communicate with potential partners with ease. 
	Our streamlined chat feature keeps the focus on climbing and allows users to stay in our app for the full climbing process. 
	With the climbing market growing so rapidly, we at BelayOn hope to encourage and motivate people to meet new people, find new climbing sports, 
	and ultimately climb more.
